## Description of project in detail below

This program creates webpages for characters from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It prompts a user to type in some basic info about a character, and it automatically generates a HTML page for that character, all from the command line.

When you run it, it asks for the filename, the character’s name, the actor, a short description, and an image link. The program then adds a character quote and a YouTube clip from the movie of that character at the bottom of the page.

The header and footer of the page come from template files in the assets folder, and the CSS file makes sure everything looks good on desktop and mobile screens. You don’t need to enter any HTML or CSS yourself.

After you enter the info, the program creates the webpage and tells you the filename in the terminal. Everything else is handled automatically, including the quotes and videos. It’s designed to be simple and quick for making multiple character pages.

To use the program, the assets folder should be in the same directory as the Python file, which includes the page-head.txt, page-footer.txt, an styles.css files. The program runs entirely in the terminal, and users just need to provide the basic info when prompted.
